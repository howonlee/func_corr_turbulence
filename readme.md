Making Graphs Out of Time Series
===

I found this in "Critical brain networks", by DR Chialvo. He cites S Dodel JM Herrmann T Geisel Neurocomputing 2002. It's interesting.

So you have an incredibly large bunch of voxels in fMRI, and of course they're each a degree of freedom. But you have this time series data and you're a complex networks guy, and so you want a network, a graph.

To define the links, you define as functionally connected those brain sites whose temporal evolution are correlated beyond some threshhold.
